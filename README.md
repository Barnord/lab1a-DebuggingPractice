Clone the repo, navigate into the lab1aDebuggingPractice folder, then the same folder, bin, Debug, net5.0, and run the lab1aDebuggingPractice.exe

## Purpose
It's a game that helped me learn some fundamentals of C#.

## Appearance
It's a command line program, so it's all just text in a boring looking box.
